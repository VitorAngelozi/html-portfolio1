<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Vitor Angelozi. I was born in Brazil, and I am 19 years old. I am working very hard to prepare myself for a career in programming</p>

<p>I studied Engineering Physics for one year at UFMS, where I discovered my passion for programming. Since then, I have been preparing to pursue a college degree in a programming-related field. I am also self-studying JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and similar technologies.</p>
